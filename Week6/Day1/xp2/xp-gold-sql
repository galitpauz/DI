-- Create a database called bootcamp.
-- Create a table called students.


CREATE TABLE bootcamp.students(
 student_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
 first_name VARCHAR (50) NOT NULL,
 last_name VARCHAR (100) NOT NULL,
 birth_date DATE NOT NULL
)


-- Add the following columns:
-- id
-- last_name
-- first_name
-- birth_date.
-- The id must be auto_incremented.
-- Make sure to choose the correct data type for each column.
-- To help, here is the data that you will have to insert. (How do we insert a date to a table?)

-- first_name	last_name	birth_date D/M/Y
-- Marc	Benichou	02/11/1998
-- Yoan	Cohen	03/12/2010
-- Lea	Benichou	27/07/1987
-- Amelia	Dux	07/04/1996
-- David	Grez	14/06/2003
-- Omer	Simpson	03/10/1980

INSERT INTO students (first_name, last_name, birth_date)
VALUES('Marc','Benichou','02/10/1998');
